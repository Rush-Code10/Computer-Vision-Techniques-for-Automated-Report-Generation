# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create standardized data structures and extract existing implementations





  - Create simple Python classes for storing results (change areas, regions, processing time)
  - Extract the core logic from each of the 3 existing notebooks into separate Python functions
  - Make each implementation return results in the same standardized format
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Build unified runner and basic accuracy evaluation





  - Create a main script that can run all three implementations on the same input images
  - Implement basic accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) when ground truth is available
  - Add simple inter-method agreement analysis (how much the methods agree with each other)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Create standardized report generation





  - Build a report generator that creates consistent PDF reports for each method
  - Include standard sections: method description, results summary, change statistics, and visualizations
  - Generate a comparison report showing all three methods side-by-side
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 5.1_

- [x] 4. Implement visualization components





  - Create consistent visualizations (change masks, overlays) with the same color scheme and legends
  - Generate comparison plots showing accuracy metrics and method performance
  - Add simple charts showing change area statistics and processing times
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Add configuration and workflow management





  - Create a simple configuration file to set parameters for all methods
  - Build a command-line interface to run individual methods or all methods together
  - Add basic logging and progress tracking
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Test and finalize the system








  - Test the complete workflow with the Orlando airport images
  - Validate that all reports are generated correctly and consistently
  - Create a simple user guide and example usage
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3, 5.3_
