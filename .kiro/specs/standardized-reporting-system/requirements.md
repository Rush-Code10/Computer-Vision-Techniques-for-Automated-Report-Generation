# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a standardized output format and reporting system for automated infrastructure development analysis from satellite imagery. The system will unify the outputs from three different implementations (basic computer vision, advanced computer vision, and deep learning) into a consistent format while providing accuracy evaluation capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing infrastructure development, I want all three implementations to produce reports in the same standardized format, so that I can easily compare results and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any implementation completes its analysis THEN the system SHALL generate a report containing standardized metrics including total change area, number of change regions, confidence scores, and processing time
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include visual outputs with consistent styling, legends, and annotations across all implementations
3. WHEN multiple implementations are run THEN the system SHALL produce a unified comparison report showing side-by-side results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance analyst, I want to evaluate the accuracy of different change detection methods, so that I can determine which approach works best for specific scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ground truth data is available THEN the system SHALL calculate precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU metrics for each implementation
2. WHEN no ground truth exists THEN the system SHALL provide inter-method agreement scores and confidence intervals
3. WHEN accuracy evaluation is performed THEN the system SHALL generate statistical reports with visualizations showing performance comparisons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a unified interface to run all implementations and generate reports, so that I can streamline the analysis workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is invoked THEN it SHALL provide options to run individual implementations or all implementations together
2. WHEN processing multiple implementations THEN the system SHALL handle different input requirements and parameter configurations automatically
3. WHEN generating outputs THEN the system SHALL create organized directory structures with timestamped results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want standardized metadata and configuration tracking, so that I can reproduce results and understand the parameters used for each analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL log all configuration parameters, timestamps, and system information
2. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL include metadata sections with implementation details and parameter settings
3. WHEN results are saved THEN the system SHALL maintain version control and provenance information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want executive summary reports with key findings and recommendations, so that I can quickly understand the infrastructure changes without technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate executive summaries with high-level findings and change statistics
2. WHEN significant changes are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight critical areas and provide contextual information
3. WHEN multiple time periods are analyzed THEN the system SHALL show trends and development patterns over time
