   Use Otsu's method for automatic threshold determination
   Create binary mask where white pixels indicate changes

3. Post-processing and Refinement

IMPLEMENTATION 3: DEEP LEARNING INSPIRED APPROACH

Description
Implementation 3 incorporates techniques inspired by deep learning methodologies, including advanced preprocessing, multi-criteria confidence scoring, and sophisticated filtering methods. While not using actual neural networks, it applies principles commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

Key Technologies and Methods

   Preserves edges while reducing noise
   Better than simple Gaussian blur for structural preservation

3. Multi-threshold Strategy
   Calculate Otsu threshold automatically
   Calculate 95th percentile threshold
   Combine both masks using logical OR operation
   Captures both statistical and intensity-based changes

4. Sophisticated Morphological Processing
   Use two different kernel sizes:
     Small kernel (3x3) for opening (noise removal)
     Large kernel (7x7) for closing (gap filling)
   Sequential application for optimal results

5. Advanced Confidence Calculation
   Intensity Component (70% weight):
     Average filtered difference intensity within region
     Normalized to 0.0-1.0 range
   Shape Component (30% weight):
